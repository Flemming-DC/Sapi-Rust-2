ResArray evt. rename LimArray

benyt en struct such as
    toks: ResArray 
    locs: ResArray 
where Tok contains Idx to locs and to source string. If generated it may have idx to generated str

---------- grammar ---------- 

Script -> (Query else pass)*
Query -> Selection | Insertion | Updation | Deletion | WithQuery
// (Query) is a nested query and thus either a subquery or a cte
// pass kunne evt hedde invariant, since they are treated the same way by every query 
pass -> ((identifier.)*identifier | | ignored | (Query))*

// this from clause doesnt allow combining identifier... with join
Selection -> select json? multiple? to_indices? pass from (identifier... else pass) pass
Insertion -> insert into ((identifier... (key_fixes) (sql-insert or perhaps explicit values blah | Selection)+) else pass) 
Updation -> 
Deletion -> 
WithQuery -> With Script


// overwrite ??
ignored --> anything except the interesting tok types



Stmt -> Query | DDL // DDL is omitted in sapi, so query is root node
Block_with_paren -> (Query)
Block -> Selection | Insertion | Updation | Deletion


---------- ast ---------- 

enum
    Script
    Query
    Pass
    Selection
    Insertion 
    Updation  
    Deletion  
    WithQuery

---------- semantic analysis ---------- 
any query
    Pass has already collected identifiers (with any provided prefix) in parser.
    resolve identifers into schema.tab.col or report amguity / unrecognized errors
selection
    build tree
    find path    
insertion
    get keys

---------- generate tokens ---------- 
any query
    copy tokens
    remove ...
selection
    insert prefixes (with type generated)
    insert joins (with type generated)
    


---------- to sql string ---------- 

loop over generated tokes
